Machine learning is a technique that discovers previously unknown relationships in data by
searching potentially very large data sets to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple statistical a
nalysis. Machine learning uses sophisticated algorithms that are trained to identify patterns in data, creating m
odels. Those models can be used to make predictions and categorize data.

Note that an algorithm isnâ€™t the same as a model. An algorithm is a set of rules and procedures used to 
solve a specific problem or perform a particular task, while a model is the output or result of applying an algorithm to a data set.

Before training, you have an algorithm. After training, you have a model.

For example, machine learning is widely used in healthcare for tasks including medical imaging analysis,
 predictive analytics, and disease diagnosis. Machine learning models are ideally suited to analyze medical 
 images, such as MRI scans, X-rays, and CT scans, to identify patterns and detect abnormalities that may not
  be visible to the human eye or that an overworked diagnostician might miss. Machine learning systems can also 
  analyze symptoms, genetic information, and other patient data to suggest tests for conditions such as cancer, 
  diabetes, and heart disease.

The key features of machine learning are the

Automatic discovery of patterns
Prediction of likely outcomes
Creation of actionable information
Ability to analyze very large volumes of data
